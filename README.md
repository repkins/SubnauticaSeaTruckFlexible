# Seatruck flexible for Subnautica: Below Zero

A modification for Subnautica: Below Zero game running on Unity Engine enabling flexibility behavour of in-game truck underwater vehicle.

## Overview

This modification adds **Unity joints** between connected Seatruck vehicle modules which provides physics-based trail-like movement across entire vehicle composition. 

As modules rotate around joints, it also deforms connection meshes between modules supported by **manually added bone-weights data** to those meshes, remaking into Unity skinned mesh instances of those connectors.
